DAVID J. MALAN: All right,
this is CS50's Introduction

to Programming with Python.

My name is David Malan, and this is our
week on object-oriented programming,

or OOP.

It turns out that, in
the world of programming,

there's different paradigms
of programming languages.

There's different ways of
solving problems with code,

and it's a little hard
to see this at first

if you've only learned one language.

But over time, if and when you learn
other languages besides Python,

you'll start to notice certain
patterns and certain capabilities

of some languages but not another.

Thus far, within the
world of Python, you and I

have largely been writing code that's
procedural in nature, whereby we're

writing procedures;
we're writing functions;

and we're doing things top to bottom.

Everything is step by
step by step, as you would

expect in general from an algorithm.

But along the way,
we've actually dabbled

in another paradigm known as functional
programming with Python whereby we've

been able to pass functions around.

We even had an anonymous
function some weeks ago.

And that's evidence of features of
a functional programming language,

even though we've just
scratched the surface thereof.

Today we focus on another paradigm,
and this one in more detail--

namely object-oriented programming.
And the idea here is that
we can define our own types
of data structures, our own types
